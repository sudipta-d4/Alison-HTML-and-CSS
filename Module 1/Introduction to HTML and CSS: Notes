# What are HTML and CSS?

# HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies for building Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the

# Guide to HTML:
<!DOCTYPE html> - This is a declaration saying we are going to use HTML code inside of it
<html> - We are including all our HTML code inside of it. The <> are HTML tags and there are opening and closing tags. I.E. Opening = <html> and Closing = </html>
<head> - Head tag is the set up of the page but is invisble to the user. You can only see it if you go to view source on a browser. 
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Page Title</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
