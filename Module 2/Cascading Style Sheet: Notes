# Introduction to CSS Grid
# CSS grid layout or CSS grid creates complex responsive web design grid layouts more easily and consistently across browsers.
# The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">3</div>
</div>

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  column-gap: 50px;
}

# CSS Fonts
# In CSS there are five generic font families:

# Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
# Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
# Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 
# Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.
# Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.

# All the different font names belong to one of the generic font families.

# Examples:
- Serif	are Times New Roman, Georgia or Garamond
- Sans-serif are	Arial, Verdana or Helvetica
- Monospace	are Courier New, Lucida Console or Monaco
- Cursive	are Brush Script MT or Lucida Handwriting
- Fantasy	are Copperplate or Papyrus
